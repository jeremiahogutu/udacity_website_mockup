I have learned the basic html structure of a website and how to use various tags to add html elements to a website. I was able to apply this skills to create a mockup website

It was easy to add html tags especially with the autocomplete feature in a text editor such as sublime.

Research from w3schools and MDN helped me alot to find the tags I wasn't sure about.
